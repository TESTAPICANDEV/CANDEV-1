Re-Imagine Energy Data

In this Project we create a visualization of letter of comment sent to Canada Energy Regulator.
We first scrap the PDF Files and extract the file to a text. 
We then extract the key words from the text file. Here we mainly focus on parameters,
-Writer's Tittle,
-Writter's Location
-Writers' Theme,
-Project Name( file name being adressed)
-Project Location.

after producing this dataset we visualize what can possiblly done and how we can group them and understand the demographic through 
visualiazation using Power Bi.

Note. eventhough we started to write the NLP algorithm, the time allocated was not enough. We showed how the pdf and can be scrapped and 
key words be extrated and Produced a randomized Mock data to show how the data looks like.
