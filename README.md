Re-Imagine Energy Data

In this Project we create a visualization of letter of comment sent to Canada Energy Regulator.
We first scrape the PDF Files and extract the file to a text. 
We then extract the key words from the text file. Here we mainly focus on parameters,
-Writer's Title
-Writter's Location
-Theme of letter
-Project Name( file name being addressed)
-Project Location.

After producing this dataset we visualized some examples of what the new data can provide. 
visualiazation using Power Bi.

Precidents exist for the types of algorithms we have proposed. While we could not write the algorithms in the allotted time, we are confident that our ideas are implementable. We used mock data to create example visualizations.
